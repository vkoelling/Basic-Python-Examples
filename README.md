##### These files are Python notes and example files that I have created for use by students in my classes and for those doing research with me. These examples are intended to help learn the basics of the Python programming language. They are derived from lessons in this book:

Jones, M. 2013. Python for Biologists. 1st edition. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.

##### Example materials that came with the text are not posted here. They are available from the Python for Biologists website.
